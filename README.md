# smaug

Smaug is a (fullstack) in-development bug tracker MVC web app that I'm currently developing as my first portfolio project. Built on java, it leverages Springboot, Spring Security, Hibernate and Thymeleaf (as well as mySQL for CRUD operations).

To be migrated/refactored soon to an SPA using React for the frontend.
